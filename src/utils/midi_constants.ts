 SFSPEC24 section 8.2.1:
 Note that in this case where C is set to 1, index values 0, 6, 32, 38, 98 through 101, and 120 through 127 are ILLEGAL due
 to their nature as a MIDI functions rather than true MIDI controllers. Also, index values 33 through 63 should be reserved
 for LSB contributions of controller indices 1 through 31. If these index values are encountered, the entire modulator
 structure should be ignored.
