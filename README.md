Online SoundFont/DLS Editor, written in TypeScript and React.

This ~~will be~~ an online SoundFont/DLS editor based on [spessasynth_core](https://github.com/spessasus/spessasynth_core) and heavily inspired by [polyphone](https://github.com/davy7125/polyphone).
This is also my first TypeScript and react project.

Stay tuned!
